# Programming Language Theory Labs

This repository is dedicated to exploring fundamental concepts in programming language theory through three practical labs. Each lab dives into a specific topic, providing hands-on experience with parsing and grammar, JavaScript prototypes, and C++ templates.

## Lab Overview

### Lab 1: Parser and Grammatical Practice

The first lab focuses on building a parser and practicing grammatical analysis to deepen understanding of syntax and parsing mechanisms.

**Topics Covered:**
- Grammar and syntax analysis
- Building a simple parser

### Lab 2: JavaScript Array Iterator

In the second lab, we use JavaScript prototypes to implement a custom array iterator. This lab is designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.

**Topics Covered:**
- JavaScript prototypes
- Implementing an array iterator

### Lab 3: Compile-Time Power Function in C++

The third lab explores the use of templates in C++ to create a compile-time power function. This advanced topic showcases the capabilities of C++ templates for metaprogramming.

**Topics Covered:**
- C++ templates
- Compile-time programming

## Getting Started

To get started with these labs, clone this repository to your local machine. Each lab is contained in its own directory and includes a README with detailed instructions on how to run and test your implementations.
